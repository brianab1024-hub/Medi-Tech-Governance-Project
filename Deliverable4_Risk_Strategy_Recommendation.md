# Deliverable 4 – Risk Strategy Recommendation
(CompTIA Security+ Objective 5.2)

Based on the qualitative assessment, **Risk R-1 (Supply Chain Insider Compromise)** poses the greatest threat to Medi-Tech due to the sensitivity of customer PII/PHI and potential regulatory penalties.

---

## 📌 Recommended Strategy: **MITIGATE**

### ✔️ Why Not Avoid?
AeroData's cloud service is critical to scaling Medi-Tech’s operations. Avoidance would disrupt business goals.

### ✔️ Why Not Accept?
The consequences of a compromise (HIPAA/GDPR violations, customer harm, lawsuits) are too severe.

### ✔️ Why Not Transfer?
Cyber insurance cannot replace regulatory compliance or eliminate liability for improper oversight.

---

## ✔️ Mitigation Plan

### **1. Contractual Controls**
- Enforce a robust **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**.  
- Include a strong **Right-to-Audit clause**.  

### **2. Technical Controls**
- Require encryption **in transit** and **at rest**.  
- Require annual **SOC 2 Type II** reports.  
- Enforce strict access control for privileged users.  
- Mandate a **7-day SLA** for patching critical vulnerabilities.

## ✔️ Final Summary

Mitigation reduces the **residual risk** to an acceptable level while allowing Medi-Tech to achieve performance, scalability, and compliance objectives during the cloud migration.
